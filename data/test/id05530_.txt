Farewell to the patriotic scene, to the love of liberty and well earned meed of virtuous aspiration farewell to crowded senate, vocal with the councils of the wise, whose laws were keener than the sword blade tempered at Damascus farewell to kingly pomp and warlike pageantry; the crowns are in the dust, and the wearers are in their graves farewell to the desire of rule, and the hope of victory; to high vaulting ambition, to the appetite for praise, and the craving for the suffrage of their fellows The nations are no longer No senate sits in council for the dead; no scion of a time honoured dynasty pants to rule over the inhabitants of a charnel house; the general's hand is cold, and the soldier has his untimely grave dug in his native fields, unhonoured, though in youth.
