ILL FATED and mysterious man bewildered in the brilliancy of thine own imagination, and fallen in the flames of thine own youth Again in fancy I behold thee Once more thy form hath risen before me not oh not as thou art in the cold valley and shadow but as thou shouldst be squandering away a life of magnificent meditation in that city of dim visions, thine own Venice which is a star beloved Elysium of the sea, and the wide windows of whose Palladian palaces look down with a deep and bitter meaning upon the secrets of her silent waters.
