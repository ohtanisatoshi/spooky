The earth was to me a magic lantern and I a gazer, and a listener but no actor; but then came the transporting and soul reviving era of my existence: my father returned and I could pour my warm affections on a human heart; there was a new sun and a new earth created to me; the waters of existence sparkled: joy joy but, alas what grief My bliss was more rapid than the progress of a sunbeam on a mountain, which discloses its glades woods, and then leaves it dark blank; to my happiness followed madness and agony, closed by despair.
