"Poor William" said he, "dear lovely child, he now sleeps with his angel mother Who that had seen him bright and joyous in his young beauty, but must weep over his untimely loss To die so miserably; to feel the murderer's grasp How much more a murdered that could destroy radiant innocence Poor little fellow one only consolation have we; his friends mourn and weep, but he is at rest.
