So we must leave thee, thou marvel of the world; we must bid farewell to thy clouds, and cold, and scarcity for ever Thy manly hearts are still; thy tale of power and liberty at its close Bereft of man, O little isle the ocean waves will buffet thee, and the raven flap his wings over thee; thy soil will be birth place of weeds, thy sky will canopy barrenness.
