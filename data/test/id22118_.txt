Now I do not complain of these ancients so much because their logic is, by their own showing, utterly baseless, worthless and fantastic altogether, as because of their pompous and imbecile proscription of all other roads of Truth, of all other means for its attainment than the two preposterous paths the one of creeping and the one of crawling to which they have dared to confine the Soul that loves nothing so well as to soar.
