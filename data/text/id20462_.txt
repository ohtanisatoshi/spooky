I gasped could not ask that which I longed to know the friendly spirit replied more gravely I have told you that you will not see those whom you mourn But I must away follow me or I must leave you weeping deserted by the spirit that now checks your tears Go I replied I cannot follow I can only sit here grieve long to see those who are gone for ever for to nought but what has relation to them can I listen The spirit left me to groan weep to wish the sun quenched in eternal darkness to accuse the air the waters all all the universe of my utter irremediable misery Fantasia came again and ever when she came tempted me to follow her but as to follow her was to leave for a while the thought of those loved ones whose memories were my all although they were my torment I dared not go Stay with me I cried help me to clothe my bitter thoughts in lovelier colours give me hope although fallacious images of what has been although it never will be again diversion I cannot take cruel fairy do you leave me alas all my joy fades at thy departure but I may not follow thee One day after one of these combats when the spirit had left me I wandered on along the banks of the river to try to disperse the excessive misery that I felt untill overcome by fatigue my eyes weighed down by tears I lay down under the shade of trees fell asleep I slept long and when I awoke I knew not where I was I did not see the river or the distant city but I lay beside a lovely fountain shadowed over by willows surrounded by blooming myrtles at a short distance the air seemed pierced by the spiry pines cypresses and the ground was covered by short moss sweet smelling heath the sky was blue but not dazzling like that of Rome and on every side I saw long allies clusters of trees with intervening lawns gently stealing rivers Where am I? I exclaimed looking around me I beheld Fantasia She smiled as she smiled all the enchanting scene appeared lovelier rainbows played in the fountain the heath flowers at our feet appeared as if just refreshed by dew I have seized you, said she as you slept and will for some little time retain you as my prisoner I will introduce you to some of the inhabitants of these peaceful Gardens It shall not be to any whose exuberant happiness will form an unpleasing contrast with your heavy grief but it shall be to those whose chief care here is to acquired knowledged sic virtue or to those who having just escaped from care pain have not yet recovered full sense of enjoyment This part of these Elysian Gardens is devoted to those who as before in your world wished to become wise virtuous by study action here endeavour after the same ends by contemplation They are still unknowing of their final destination but they have a clear knowledge of what on earth is only supposed by some which is that their happiness now hereafter depends upon their intellectual improvement Nor do they only study the forms of this universe but search deeply in their own minds and love to meet converse on all those high subjects of which the philosophers of Athens loved to treat With deep feelings but with no outward circumstances to excite their passions you will perhaps imagine that their life is uniform dull but these sages are of that disposition fitted to find wisdom in every thing in every lovely colour or form ideas that excite their love Besides many years are consumed before they arrive here When a soul longing for knowledge pining at its narrow conceptions escapes from your earth many spirits wait to receive it and to open its eyes to the mysteries of the universe many centuries are often consumed in these travels and they at last retire here to digest their knowledge to become still wiser by thought and imagination working upon memory When the fitting period is accomplished they leave this garden to inhabit another world fitted for the reception of beings almost infinitely wise but what this world is neither can you conceive or I teach you some of the spirits whom you will see here are yet unknowing in the secrets of nature They are those whom care sorrow have consumed on earth whose hearts although active in virtue have been shut through suffering from knowledge These spend sometime here to recover their equanimity to get a thirst of knowledge from converse with their wiser companions They now securely hope to see again those whom they love know that it is ignorance alone that detains them from them.
