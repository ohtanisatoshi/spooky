This also was my doing And my father's woe, and the desolation of that late so smiling home all was the work of my thrice accursed hands Ye weep, unhappy ones, but these are not your last tears Again shall you raise the funeral wail, and the sound of your lamentations shall again and again be heard Frankenstein, your son, your kinsman, your early, much loved friend; he who would spend each vital drop of blood for your sakes, who has no thought nor sense of joy except as it is mirrored also in your dear countenances, who would fill the air with blessings and spend his life in serving you he bids you weep, to shed countless tears; happy beyond his hopes, if thus inexorable fate be satisfied, and if the destruction pause before the peace of the grave have succeeded to your sad torments Thus spoke my prophetic soul, as, torn by remorse, horror, and despair, I beheld those I loved spend vain sorrow upon the graves of William and Justine, the first hapless victims to my unhallowed arts.
