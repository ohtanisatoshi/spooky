Where was I? Ah I have been assured that Snobbs is a mere corruption of Zenobia, and that Zenobia was a queen So am I. Dr. Moneypenny always calls me the Queen of the Hearts and that Zenobia, as well as Psyche, is good Greek, and that my father was "a Greek," and that consequently I have a right to our patronymic, which is Zenobia and not by any means Snobbs.
