To this life, miserable father, I devote thee Go Be thy days passed with savages, and thy nights under the cope of heaven Be thy limbs worn and thy heart chilled, and all youth be dead within thee Let thy hairs be as snow; thy walk trembling and thy voice have lost its mellow tones Let the liquid lustre of thine eyes be quenched; and then return to me, return to thy Mathilda, thy child, who may then be clasped in thy loved arms, while thy heart beats with sinless emotion.
