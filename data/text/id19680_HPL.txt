There is a false report very commonly reproduced in modern books prior to Von Schweinkopf's monumental Geschichte der Ostrogothen in Italien that Ibid was a Romanised Visigoth of Ataulf's horde who settled in Placentia about A.D. The contrary cannot be too strongly emphasised; for Von Schweinkopf, and since his time Littlewit and BÃªtenoir, have shewn with irrefutable force that this strikingly isolated figure was a genuine Roman or at least as genuine a Roman as that degenerate and mongrelised age could produce of whom one might well say what Gibbon said of Boethius, "that he was the last whom Cato or Tully could have acknowledged for their countryman."
