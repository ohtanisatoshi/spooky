Now let us suppose this sense of the Almighty design to be one step depressed to be brought into something like harmony or consistency with the sense of human art to form an intermedium between the two: let us imagine, for example, a landscape whose combined vastness and definitiveness whose united beauty, magnificence, and strangeness, shall convey the idea of care, or culture, or superintendence, on the part of beings superior, yet akin to humanity then the sentiment of interest is preserved, while the art intervolved is made to assume the air of an intermediate or secondary nature a nature which is not God, nor an emanation from God, but which still is nature in the sense of the handiwork of the angels that hover between man and God."
