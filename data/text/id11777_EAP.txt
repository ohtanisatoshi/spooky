'The Literary World' speaks of him, confidently, as a native of Presburg misled, perhaps, by the account in 'The Home Journal' but I am pleased in being able to state positively, since I have it from his own lips, that he was born in Utica, in the State of New York, although both his parents, I believe, are of Presburg descent.
