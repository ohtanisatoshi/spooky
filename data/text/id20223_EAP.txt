Mimes, in the form of God on high, Mutter and mumble low, And hither and thither fly; Mere puppets they, who come and go At bidding of vast formless things That shift the scenery to and fro, Flapping from out their Condor wings Invisible Wo That motley drama oh, be sure It shall not be forgot With its Phantom chased forever more, By a crowd that seize it not, Through a circle that ever returneth in To the self same spot, And much of Madness and more of Sin And Horror the soul of the plot.
