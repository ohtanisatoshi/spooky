We assembled generally at seven o'clock of an Evening, once a Week, at the Turk's Head, in Gerrard Street, Soho, till that Tavern was sold and made into a private Dwelling; after which Event we mov'd our Gatherings successively to Prince's in Sackville Street, Le Tellier's in Dover Street, and Parsloe's and The Thatched House in St. James's Street.
