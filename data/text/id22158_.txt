A blush spread over the cheek of the lovely girl Alas, replied she what a tale must I relate what dark phrenzied passions must I unfold When you Diotima lived on earth your soul seemed to mingle in love only with its own essence to be unknowing of the various tortures which that heart endures who if it has not sympathized with has been witness of the dreadful struggles of a soul enchained by dark deep passions which were its hell yet from which it could not escape Are there in the peaceful language used by the inhabitants of these regions words burning enough to paint the tortures of the human heart Can you understand them? or can you in any way sympathize with them alas though dead I do and my tears flow as when I lived when my memory recalls the dreadful images of the past As the lovely girl spoke my own eyes filled with bitter drops the spirit of Fantasia seemed to fade from within me and when after placing my hand before my swimming eyes I withdrew it again I found myself under the trees on the banks of the Tiber The sun was just setting tinging with crimson the clouds that floated over St. Peters all was still no human voice was heard the very air was quiet I rose bewildered with the grief that I felt within me the recollection of what I had heard I hastened to the city that I might see human beings not that I might forget my wandering recollections but that I might impress on my mind what was reality what was either dream or at least not of this earth The Corso of Rome was filled with carriages and as I walked up the Trinita dei' Montes I became disgusted with the crowd that I saw about me the vacancy want of beauty not to say deformity of the many beings who meaninglessly buzzed about me I hastened to my room which overlooked the whole city which as night came on became tranquil Silent lovely Rome I now gaze on thee thy domes are illuminated by the moon and the ghosts of lovely memories float with the night breeze among thy ruins contemplating thy loveliness which half soothes my miserable heart I record what I have seen Tomorrow I will again woo Fantasia to lead me to the same walks invite her to visit me with her visions which I before neglected Oh let me learn this lesson while yet it may be useful to me that to a mind hopeless unhappy as mine a moment of forgetfullness a moment in which it can pass out of itself is worth a life of painful recollection.
