Ah, Death, the spectre which sate at all feasts How often, Monos, did we lose ourselves in speculations upon its nature How mysteriously did it act as a check to human bliss saying unto it "thus far, and no farther" That earnest mutual love, my own Monos, which burned within our bosoms how vainly did we flatter ourselves, feeling happy in its first up springing, that our happiness would strengthen with its strength Alas as it grew, so grew in our hearts the dread of that evil hour which was hurrying to separate us forever Thus, in time, it became painful to love.
