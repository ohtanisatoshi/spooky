far below the animals of the field preying on one anothers sic hearts; happy in the downfall of others themselves holding on with bent necks and cruel eyes to a wretch more a slave if possible than they to his miserable passions And if I said these are the consequences of civilization turned to the savage world I saw only ignorance unrepaid by any noble feeling a mere animal, love of life joined to a low love of power a fiendish love of destruction I saw a creature drawn on by his senses his selfish passions but untouched by aught noble or even Human And then when I sought for consolation in the various faculties man is possessed of which I felt burning within me I found that spirit of union with love beauty which formed my happiness pride degraded into superstition turned from its natural growth which could bring forth only good fruit: cruelty intolerance hard tyranny was grafted on its trunk from it sprung fruit suitable to such grafts If I mingled with my fellow creatures was the voice I heard that of love virtue or that of selfishness vice, still misery was ever joined to it the tears of mankind formed a vast sea ever blown on by its sighs seldom illuminated by its smiles Such taking only one side of the picture shutting wisdom from the view is a just portraiture of the creation as seen on earth But when I compared the good evil of the world wished to divide them into two seperate principles I found them inextricably intwined together I was again cast into perplexity doubt I might have considered the earth as an imperfect formation where having bad materials to work on the Creator could only palliate the evil effects of his combinations but I saw a wanton malignity in many parts particularly in the mind of man that baffled me a delight in mischief a love of evil for evils sake a siding of the multitude a dastardly applause which in their hearts the crowd gave to triumphant wickedness over lowly virtue that filled me with painful sensations.
