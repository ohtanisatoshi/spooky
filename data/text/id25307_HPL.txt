The immediate problem was how to reach the ancient railway; and I now saw that the safest course was ahead to Babson Street, then west to Lafayette there edging around but not crossing an open space homologous to the one I had traversed and subsequently back northward and westward in a zigzagging line through Lafayette, Bates, Adams, and Bank Streets the latter skirting the river gorge to the abandoned and dilapidated station I had seen from my window.
