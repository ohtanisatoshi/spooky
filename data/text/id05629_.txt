Gad split me I'd rather be red whilst I'm here, Than white as a lily and dead half a year So Betty, my miss, Come give me a kiss; In hell there's no innkeeper's daughter like this Young Harry, propp'd up just as straight as he's able, Will soon lose his wig and slip under the table; But fill up your goblets and pass 'em around Better under the table than under the ground So revel and chaff As ye thirstily quaff: Under six feet of dirt 'tis less easy to laugh The fiend strike me blue I'm scarce able to walk, And damn me if I can stand upright or talk Here, landlord, bid Betty to summon a chair; I'll try home for a while, for my wife is not there So lend me a hand; I'm not able to stand, But I'm gay whilst I linger on top of the land About this time I conceived my present fear of fire and thunderstorms.
