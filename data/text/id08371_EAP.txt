"No more no more no more," Such language holds the solemn sea To the sands upon the shore, Shall bloom the thunder blasted tree, Or the stricken eagle soar Now all my hours are trances; And all my nightly dreams Are where the dark eye glances, And where thy footstep gleams, In what ethereal dances, By what Italian streams.
