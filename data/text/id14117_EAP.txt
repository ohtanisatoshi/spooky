End of Text Notes to Hans Pfaal NOTE Strictly speaking, there is but little similarity between the above sketchy trifle and the celebrated "Moon Story" of Mr. Locke; but as both have the character of hoaxes although the one is in a tone of banter, the other of downright earnest, and as both hoaxes are on the same subject, the moon moreover, as both attempt to give plausibility by scientific detail the author of "Hans Pfaall" thinks it necessary to say, in self defence, that his own jeu d'esprit was published in the "Southern Literary Messenger" about three weeks before the commencement of Mr. L's in the "New York Sun." Fancying a likeness which, perhaps, does not exist, some of the New York papers copied "Hans Pfaall," and collated it with the "Moon Hoax," by way of detecting the writer of the one in the writer of the other.
